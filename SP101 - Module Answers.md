5. Role and Responsibility of Computer Scientists

    <i><b>Activity:</b> Discuss a scenario where a computer scientist faced an ethical dilemma. Explore how they navigated the situation and what lessons can be learned for future practice.</i>

    <i><b>Scenario:</b> The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica Data Scandal</i>

    * **Background**

        >In 2018, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users without their consent. This data was used to influence voter behavior in several major political campaigns, including the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. The data was initially collected through a seemingly innocuous personality quiz on Facebook, which accessed not only the quiz participants' data but also the data of their friends, violating user privacy on a massive scale.
        >
        >At the heart of this scandal was a computer scientist named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who developed the quiz app that collected the data. Though he claimed that the app was designed for academic research, the data was later passed on to Cambridge Analytica, which used it for commercial and political purposes.

    * **Ethical Dilemma**

        >Dr. Kogan faced a significant ethical dilemma when deciding how to handle the user data collected through his app. On the one hand, he was conducting research under the guise of academic purposes, but on the other hand, this data was being sold and used to manipulate public opinion without the users’ knowledge or consent.

        * How the Situation Was Navigated

            * Initial Decision

                >Kogan chose to develop the quiz app and collect user data, knowing that Facebook’s policies at the time were relatively lax about third-party access to user information. However, he did not fully disclose the potential commercial uses of the data to the users.

            * Collaboration with Cambridge Analytica

                >He shared the data with Cambridge Analytica, a decision that violated Facebook's terms of service and the trust of users. This choice led to the large-scale misuse of personal data for political gain.

            * Public Response

                >Once the scandal broke, Kogan defended his actions, claiming that he did not know how Cambridge Analytica would use the data and that he was unaware of any wrongdoing. He argued that Facebook had allowed such data access for years and that he was operating within the framework of the platform’s existing policies.

        * Lessons Learned

            * User Consent is Critical

                >One of the major takeaways from this scenario is the importance of informed user consent. Users were not fully aware of the extent of data collection, nor did they consent to their data being used for political purposes. Future computer scientists must prioritize transparency and ensure that users are fully informed about how their data will be used.

            * Responsibility Beyond Legal Boundaries

                >Although Kogan may have technically operated within Facebook’s policies at the time, his actions violated the ethical principle of protecting user privacy. This case highlights the need for professionals to consider ethical implications beyond just the legal framework. Computer scientists should ask whether their actions respect user autonomy and privacy.

            * Data Use Transparency

                >Companies and researchers must be transparent about how user data is collected, stored, and used. Any potential commercial or political uses of data should be explicitly disclosed. This scenario emphasizes the need for stricter ethical standards in data collection practices.

            * Stricter Data Protection Policies

                >The fallout from this scandal resulted in tighter regulations (such as GDPR) and an increased focus on data protection and privacy. The lesson for future computer scientists is clear: adhere to robust data protection practices, even if the current legal framework is lenient.

    * **Conclusion**

        >Dr. Kogan’s ethical dilemma serves as a cautionary tale for computer scientists. While the legal framework surrounding data use has evolved, the underlying ethical considerations remain the same. Professionals in this field must always prioritize user consent, transparency, and privacy when dealing with sensitive data. By doing so, they can avoid situations where their work might be exploited for harmful purposes and maintain public trust in technology.
