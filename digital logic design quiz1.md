1. <b>IDENTIFY THE FOLLOWING.</b>

   1. Number theory, also known as <b><u>higher arithmetic</u></b>.  
   2. A branch of pure mathematics that deals with the study of natural numbers and the integers is known as <b><u>number theory</u></b>.  
   3. <b><u>Prime numbers</u></b> are the numbers that have only two factors, that are, 1 and the number itself.  
   4. <b><u>Euclid</u></b> invented the modern number theory.  
   5. Numbers that are multiplied by themselves 3 times are called <b><u>cubic numbers</u></b>.  
   6. A series of numbers where a number is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0 and 1 is known as the <b><u>Fibonacci sequence</u></b>.  
   7. Numbers that are multiplied by themselves are called <b><u>perfect squares</u></b>.  
   8. The smallest composite number is <b><u>4</u></b>.  
   9. <b><u>Composite numbers</u></b> are numbers with more than two factors.  
   10. <b><u>Even numbers</u></b> are integers that are divisible by the number 2.

2. <b>Give the meaning of the following and give at least 2 examples.</b>

   1. **Odd Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** An odd number is an integer that is not divisible by 2. It has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
      
      **Examples:**
      - 1
      - 3

   2. **Even Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** An even number is an integer that is divisible by 2. It has no remainder when divided by 2.

      **Examples:**
      - 2
      - 4

   3. **Composite Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime; it has factors other than 1 and itself.

      **Examples:**
      - 4 (factors: 1, 2, 4)
      - 6 (factors: 1, 2, 3, 6)

   4. **Irrational Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. Its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.

      **Examples:** <br/>
      - √2 (approximately 1.41421356...)
      - π (approximately 3.14159...)

   5. **Rational Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.

      **Examples:**
      - 1/2
      - 3 (which can be expressed as 3/1)

   6. **Cube Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** A cube number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself three times (n³).

      **Examples:**
      - 1 (1³)
      - 8 (2³)

   7. **Square Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** A square number is the result of multiplying an integer by itself (n²).

      **Examples:**
      - 1 (1²)
      - 9 (3²)

   8. **Fibonacci Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** A Fibonacci number is a number in the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

      **Examples:**
      - 0
      - 1
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - 5

   9. **Co-prime Number** <br/>
      **Meaning:** Co-prime numbers are two or more integers that have no common factors other than 1.

      **Examples:**
      - 8 and 9
      - 14 and 15

   10. **Prime Number** <br/>
       **Meaning:** A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. It has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

       **Examples:**
       - 2
       - 5
