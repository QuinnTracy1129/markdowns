1. <b>Identification</b>

   1. A <u><b>set</b></u> is defined as a collection of distinct objects of the same type or class of objects.

   2. In this form of representation we list all the elements of the set within braces `{}` and separate them by commas. <u><b>roster form</b></u>

   3. Finite Sets are also called <u><b>numerable sets</b></u>

   4. If A is a subset of B and A ≠ B then A is said to be a <u><b>proper subsets</b></u> of B.

   5. A set is said to be <u><b>finite</b></u> if it contains exactly n distinct element where n is a non-negative integer.

   6. A set which is not countable is called Uncountable Infinite Set or <u><b>non-denumerable set or simply Uncountable</b></u>

   7. A countably infinite set is also known as <u><b>Denumerable sets</b></u>

   8. A set having no elements is called a <u><b>Null set or void set</b></u>

   9. <u><b>Singleton set</b></u> contains only one element.

   10. The <u><b>Cardinality</b></u> of sets is denoted by |A|, # A, card (A) or n (A).

   11. <u><b>N</b></u> : The set of all natural numbers.
   12. <u><b>Q, Q<sub>0</sub>, Q<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The sets of rational, non-zero rational, +ve rational numbers respectively.
   13. <u><b>x ∉ A</b></u> : x does not belong to set A.
   14. <u><b>I</b></u> : The set of all integers.
   15. <u><b>I<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The set of all + ve integers.
   16. <u><b>∅</b></u> : Empty Set.
   17. <u><b>I<sub>0</sub></b></u> : The set of all non-zero integers.
   18. <u><b>x ∈ A</b></u> : x belongs to A or x is an element of set A.
   19. <u><b>C, C<sub>0</sub></b></u> : The set of all complex, non-zero complex numbers respectively.
   20. <u><b>U</b></u> : Universal Set.

         3. What is the minimum number of people who do not like any of the brands?
            > Not liking any = Total - (H + S - (H ∩ S)) <br />
            > Using maximum intersection: <br />
            > Not liking any = 100 - (50 + 35 - 35) = 100 - 50 = 50 <br />
