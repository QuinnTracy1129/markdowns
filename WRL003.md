1. Identification

    1. A <u><b>set</b></u> is defined as a collection of distinct objects of the same type or class of objects.

    2. In this form of representation we list all the elements of the set within braces `{}` and separate them by commas. <u><b>roster form</b></u>

    3. Finite Sets are also called <u><b>numerable sets</b></u>

    4. If A is a subset of B and A ≠ B then A is said to be a <u><b>proper subsets</b></u> of B.
    
    5. A set is said to be <u><b>finite</b></u> if it contains exactly n distinct element where n is a non-negative integer.
    
    6. A set which is not countable is called Uncountable Infinite Set or <u><b>non-denumerable set or simply Uncountable</b></u>
    
    7. A countably infinite set is also known as <u><b>Denumerable sets</b></u>
    
    8. A set having no elements is called a <u><b>Null set or void set</b></u>
    
    9. <u><b>Singleton set</b></u> contains only one element.
    
    10. The <u><b>Cardinality</b></u> of sets is denoted by |A|, # A, card (A) or n (A).

<br />

1. <u><b>N</b></u> : The set of all natural numbers.
2. <u><b>Q, Q<sub>0</sub>, Q<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The sets of rational, non-zero rational, +ve rational numbers respectively.
3. <u><b>x ∉ A</b></u> : x does not belong to set A.
4. <u><b>I</b></u> : The set of all integers.
5. <u><b>I<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The set of all + ve integers.
6. <u><b>∅</b></u> : Empty Set.
7. <u><b>I<sub>0</sub></b></u> : The set of all non-zero integers.
8. <u><b>x ∈ A</b></u> : x belongs to A or x is an element of set A.
9. <u><b>C, C<sub>0</sub></b></u> : The set of all complex, non-zero complex numbers respectively.
10. <u><b>U</b></u> :  Universal Set.
