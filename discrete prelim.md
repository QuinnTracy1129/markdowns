1. <b>IDENTIFICATION.</b> Write your answer on the space provided. <b>NO ERASURE.</b>

   1. <u><b>Venn diagrams</b></u> are the diagrams that are used to represent the sets, relation between the sets and operation performed on them, in a pictorial way.
   2. A <u><b>set</b></u> is defined as a collection of distinct objects of the same type or class of objects
   3. In this form of representation we list all the elements of the set within braces `{ }` and separate them by commas. <u><b>roster form</b></u>
   4. Finite Sets are also called <u><b>numerable sets</b></u>
   5. If A is a subset of B and A ≠ B then A is said to be a <u><b>proper subset</b></u> of B.
   6. If all the sets under investigations are subsets of a fixed set U, then the set U is called <u><b>universal set</b></u>
   7. Venn diagram was introduced by <u><b>John Venn</b></u>
   8. A set is said to be <u><b>finite</b></u> if it contains exactly n distinct element where n is a non-negative integer.
   9. A set which is not countable is called Uncountable Infinite Set or <u><b>non-denumerable set or simply Uncountable</b></u>
   10. A countably infinite set is also known as <u><b>Denumerable sets</b></u>
   11. A set which is not finite is called as <u><b>infinite set</b></u>
   12. A set having no elements is called a <u><b>Null set or void set</b></u>
   13. <u><b>Singleton set</b></u> contains only one element.
   14. The <u><b>Cardinality</b></u> of sets is denoted by|A|, # A, card (A) or n (A).

   15. <u><b>N</b></u> : The set of all natural numbers.
   16. <u><b>Q, Q<sub>0</sub>, Q<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The sets of rational, non-zero rational, +ve rational numbers respectively.
   17. <u><b>x ∉ A</b></u> : x does not belong to set A.
   18. <u><b>I</b></u> : The set of all integers.
   19. <u><b>I<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The set of all + ve integers.
   20. <u><b>∅</b></u> : Empty Set.
   21. <u><b>I<sub>0</sub></b></u> : The set of all non-zero integers.
   22. <u><b>x ∈ A</b></u> : x belongs to A or x is an element of set A.
   23. <u><b>C, C<sub>0</sub></b></u> : The set of all complex, non-zero complex numbers respectively.
   24. <u><b>U</b></u> : Universal Set.
   25. <u><b>R, R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>+</sub></b></u> : The set of real, non-zero real, +ve real number respectively.

3. <b>ENUMERATION and DEFINITION.</b> 1-12 Enumerate and define the different type of sets

   1. **Empty Set (Null Set)**: A set that contains no elements, denoted by {} or ∅.

   2. **Singleton Set**: A set that contains exactly one element, e.g., {a}.

   3. **Finite Set**: A set that contains a countable number of elements. For example, {1, 2, 3}.

   4. **Infinite Set**: A set that has an uncountable number of elements, such as the set of natural numbers (ℕ).

   5. **Equal Sets**: Two sets that contain exactly the same elements, denoted as A = B.

   6. **Subset**: A set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B, denoted as A ⊆ B.

   7. **Proper Subset**: A set A is a proper subset of set B if A is a subset of B but not equal to B, denoted as A ⊂ B.

   8. **Universal Set**: The set that contains all possible elements relevant to a particular discussion, usually denoted by U.

   9. **Disjoint Sets**: Two sets that have no elements in common; their intersection is the empty set, denoted as A ∩ B = ∅.

   10. **Power Set**: The set of all possible subsets of a set A, including the empty set and A itself, denoted as P(A).

   11. **Complement Set**: The set of all elements in the universal set that are not in a given set A, denoted as A'.

   12. **Joint Sets (Mutually Exclusive Sets)**: Sets that cannot share any elements; similar to disjoint sets, meaning if A and B are joint, then A ∩ B = ∅.

4. <b>MULTIPLE CHOICES.</b> Encircle the correct answer.

      > M∪S = { 5,10,15 }
   4. <b>D. { 15 }</b>
      > M∩S = { 15 }
   5. <b>A. X U Y</b>
      > X∪Y = { z∣z∈X or z∈Y }

5. <b>VENN DIAGRAM</b>

   1. In a Junior High School, 200 students were randomly selected. 140 liked tea, 120 liked coffee and 80 liked both tea and coffee.

      - How many students liked only tea?
        > Only Tea = T − (T∩C) = 140 − 80 = 60 <br />
        > <b>Final Answer: 60</b>
      - How many students liked only coffee?
        > Only Coffee = C − (T∩C) = 120 − 80 = 40 <br />
        > <b>Final Answer: 40</b>
      - How many students liked neither tea or coffee?
        > Neither = Total − (Only Tea + Only Coffee + (T∩C)) <br />
        > <b>Final Answer: 20</b>

   2. In a group of 120 students, 68 had ridden a bus, 78 had ridden the LRT, 33 had ridden a jeep, while 40 had ridden both the bus and the LRT , 20 had ridden the bus and the jeep,19 had ridden the LRT and the jeep and 15 had ridden the bus, the LRT and the jeep.

      - How many had ridden the bus only?
        > Bus only = B − (B∩L) − (B∩J) + (B∩L∩J) <br/>
        > 68 − 40 − 20 + 15 = 23 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 23</b>
      - How many had ridden the LRT only?
        > LRT only = L − (B∩L) − (L∩J) + (B∩L∩J) <br/>
        > 78 − 40 − 19 + 15 = 34 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 34</b>
      - How many had ridden the jeep only?
        > Jeep only = J − (B∩J) − (L∩J) + (B∩L∩J) <br/>
        > 33 − 20 − 19 + 15 = 9 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 9</b>
      - How many did not ride on any of the three modes of transportation?
        > Neither = Total − (Bus only + LRT only + Jeep only + (B∩L) + (B∩J) + (L∩J) − 2(B∩L∩J)) <br/>
        > 120 − (23 + 34 + 9 + 40 + 20 + 19 − 2×15)=120−(120−15) = 15 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 15</b>

Out of 50 students, 24 joined the trip in Lake Sebu for a zipline experience, 18 went to the flower farm in Tupi, 20 went to Si – ok falls in Koronadal City, 12 joined the trip to Lake Sebu and Tupi, 15 went to Tupi and Si-ok falls and 11 made a trip to Lake Sebu and Si-ok falls and 10 visited the three tourists spots.

      - How many of the students went to Lake Sebu only?
        > LS only = LS − (LS∩T) − (LS∩S) + (LS∩T∩S) <br/>
        > 24 − 12 − 11 + 10 = 11 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 11</b> 
      - How many of the students went to Tupi only?
        > T only = T − (LS∩T) − (T∩S) + (LS∩T∩S) <br/>
        > 18 − 12 − 15 + 10 = 1 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 1</b>  
      - How many joined the Si-ok trip in Koronadal City only?
        > S only = S − (LS∩S) − (T∩S) + (LS∩T∩S) <br/>
        > 20 − 11 − 15 + 10 = 4 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 4</b>   
      - How many did not go to any of the tourist spots?
        > Neither = Total − (LS only + T only + S only + (LS∩T) + (T∩S) + (LS∩S) − 2(LS∩T∩S)) <br/>
        > 50 − (11 + 1 + 4 + 12 + 15 + 11 − 20) = 50 − 34 = 16 <br /> 
        > <b>Final Answer: 16</b>
